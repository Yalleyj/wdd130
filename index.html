        <h2>My Country is in Economic Crisis</h2>
        <li>Ghana is facing a huge problem of economic crises. The leaders in the country only think about themselves but not the people of the country. Instead of providing good layout systems and good roads for some villages like Abuesi, they would rather use our money to buy luxurious things. Below is the image showing the state of a town called Abuesi..</li>
